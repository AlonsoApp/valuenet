# ValueNet: A Neural Text-to-SQL ArchitectureIncorporating Values

Disclaimer: this code is largely based on the IRNet (https://github.com/microsoft/IRNet) repository. By now though it has diverted quite a bit from the original code base, therefore we publish it as a non-fork. We thank the IRNet team for their great work, which made this repository possible in the first place.
